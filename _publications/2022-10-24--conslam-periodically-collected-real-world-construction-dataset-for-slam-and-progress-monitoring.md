**Abstract:**  Hand-held scanners are progressively adopted to workflows on con- struction sites. Yet, they suffer from accuracy problems, preventing them from deployment for demanding use cases. In this paper, we present a real-world dataset collected periodically on a construction site to measure the accuracy of SLAM algorithms that mobile scanners utilize. The dataset contains time-synchronised and spatially registered images and LiDAR scans, inertial data and professional ground-truth scans. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available dataset which reflects the periodic need of scanning construction sites with the aim of accurate progress monitoring using a hand-held scanner.
