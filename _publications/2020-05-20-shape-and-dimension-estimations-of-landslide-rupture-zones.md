**Abstract:**  For many geotechnical purposes, the proper estimation of shapes and dimensions of landslide rupture zones is of significant importance. Very often, this exact delineation is difficult due to the lack of information on rupture zone extents in 3D. Based on a global landslide inventory, this work presents statistical analyses correlating dimension-related and shape-related parameters characterizing a rupture zone in 3D to its volume. Dimension-related parameters are approximated by linear regressions increasing with greater volumes, whereas shape-related parameters appear stable throughout the entire range of volumes. Revealing themselves as very stable, these correlations can be used, hence, to extrapolate from a distinct parameter to the volume of a landslide rupture zone. In a second stage, ratios of dimension-related parameters are correlated with rupture zone volumes. Furthermore, this type of correlation delivers very stable results showing that ratios are constant throughout the entire range of volumes. Making use of this ratio consistency, it is possible to deduce one of the two parameters when the other one is given. This latter aspect seems to be promising for remote sensing surveys when initial rupture areas or rupture volumes should be delineated or for numerical modeling of landslides in 3D.
