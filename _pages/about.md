Currently, I am affiliated with Inria Sophia Antipolis — Méditerranée ([TITANE team](https://team.inria.fr/titane/team/)). My research at Inria is focused on the problems identified by the [BIM2TWIN project](https://bim2twin.eu/). These include but are not limited to quality assessment of elements built on construction sites in using sensing technologies and geometry processing. My supervisonr at Inria is [Pierre Alliez](https://team.inria.fr/titane/team/pierre-alliez/). 

Before I started working at Inria, I was affiliated with the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, where I worked in the group of [Mirela Ben-Chen](https://mirela.net.technion.ac.il/) on problems related to geometry processing.

My Ph.D. dissertation—which I prepared under the supervision of
[Yukiko Kenmochi](http://igm.univ-mlv.fr/~kenmochi/) and [Pascal
Romon](http://perso-math.univ-mlv.fr/users/romon.pascal/)—was a study of rigid motions on discrete
spaces. 

My research focuses on topological and geometric alterations induced by digitized rigid motions
defined on regular grids. I am mainly interested in theoretical aspects of digital geometry and
digital topology.

During the last four years, I have collaborated with [Nicolas
Passat](http://crestic.univ-reims.fr/membre/1542-nicolas-passat), [Guillaume
Moroz](https://members.loria.fr/GMoroz/), [David Cœurjolly](http://liris.cnrs.fr/%7Edcoeurjo/),
[Tristan Roussillon](http://liris.cnrs.fr/~troussil/), [Victor
Ostromoukhov](https://liris.cnrs.fr/victor.ostromoukhov/) and [Gisela
Domej](https://giz-geo.jimdo.com/).

Before my Ph.D., I worked with [Marcin Janaszewski](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marcin_Janaszewski)
and [Michał Postolski](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michat_Postolski) on problems related to
modeling and segmentation of human airways.

My current [Erdős number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number) is 3.
